    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <h2>Saratoga, California</h2>
    <p>Nestled in the pristine rolling hills near the coast of California lies Saratoga.</p>
    <p>Here I enjoy the majestic, peaceful redwoods of Sanborn County.</p>
    <p>My husband led us on an adventure hopping from rock to rock up the stream that cuts through
        the forest.</p>
    <p>The memory of this time with my family makes Saratoga dear to me.</p>
